<h1>Different Ways To Configure Spring</h1>
<h3>There Are 3 Ways To Configure Spring: </h3>
<h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">XML Based Configuration</h5>
<p>In XML Based Configuration We First Make Our Beans And Then<br/>
We Define Our Beans In a XML File. After That We Can Use Our Beans</p>
<h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">Annotation Based Configuration</h5>
<p>In Annotation Based Configuration I've Defined A Student Class Which Has<br/>
Country Bean In It. For Connecting These Two Beans I've Used Autowired Annotation<br/>
Also Because I've Defined Two Beans With Different Names From Country Class, I've Used<br/>
Qualifier Annotation So As To Remove The Confusion By Specifying The Bean For Wiring.</p>
